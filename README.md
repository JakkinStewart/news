# A simple news parser
This is a simple program to parse out news from AnonOps #news feed as read from HexChat's scrollback file.
It'll separate out the news feeds into different files (still working getting rid of that), and printing out the most commonly used words.
Right now, its a proof of concept python program that works only in a *NIX environment.
