# A simple news parser
### **Dead**

This is a simple program to parse out news from an IRC news channel.
It'll separate out the news feeds into different files (still working getting rid of that), and print out news tailored to the user based on key words.
Right now, its a proof of concept python program that works only in a *nix environment.

Completed
- Support categories.

Future plans
- Expand wordlist.
- Support blacklist.
- Set alerts.

Far future plans
- Convert fully to python.
- Support other news feeds.
- Support other IRC programs. (Hopefully do away with them altogether someday.)
- Support other forms of input. (Maybe Atom or RSS.)
- Dynamically and independently recognize new keywords.
- Support other operating systems.
